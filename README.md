# Learning C++

This repo is a small sandbox for learning modern C++. I mostly work in high‑level languages, so I'm exploring a lower‑level language to better understand memory, performance, and systems programming. With future dreams of building high speed trading strategies.

Notable project:

- [Monte Carlo Pi Approximation Visualization](src/visualizations/MCPiApproximationVisualization.cpp) - Visual simulation using SFML to approximate π using random points
