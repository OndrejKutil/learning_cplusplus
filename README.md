# Learning C++

This repo is a small sandbox for learning modern C++. I mostly work in high‑level languages, so I'm exploring a lower‑level language to better understand memory, performance, and systems programming.

Structure:

- `src/[folder]`: progressively moving through C++ and leaning new concepts

Build/run:

- In VS Code, use the task "C/C++: g++.exe build active file" to compile the current file, then run the generated `.exe` next to the source.
